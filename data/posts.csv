StarkNet,Twitter,"📣Devs, if you are using Starknet’s feeder gateway, here is an important update for you:

The Starknet feeder gateway will go through changes in Q4 2023 and will stop serving multiple types of queries. It will retain only synchronization-related endpoints for Full Nodes.

The Starknet feeder gateway serves as a gateway for querying the centralized sequencer on the state of Starknet. It was meant to be a temporary solution until Full Nodes supporting Starknet’s JSON-RPC mature and can meet the ecosystem's needs.

We are working with the different API providers to ensure they're preparing for the deprecation regarding reliability and expected increased traffic.

We will proceed with the deprecation only if we feel the ecosystem is ready.

Moving towards Full Nodes and API services signifies transitioning from a centralized solution to a decentralized, resilient, and efficient system that aligns with blockchain technology principles.

Starknet devs are recommended to shift to API services or Full Nodes like Pathfinder, Juno, and Papyrus.

For a full list of Full Nodes and API services 👇

In the coming weeks we will deprecate the public API of Starknet, and we will completely remove it in the future. This shift is driven by our commitment to push decentralization and enhance Starknet’s resilience and independence. 

We’re actively encouraging the Starknet dev community to transition to using one of Starknet full nodes Pathfinder, Juno or Papyrus, or one of the existing API services.

Following the recent DAO vote, Stargate is winding down the Fantom pool. 

Users will no longer be able to transfer USDC to or from Fantom on Stargate, effective immediately. Users who have provided liquidity on Fantom are still able to withdraw their USDC on Fantom and should do so. 

Emissions on this pool have been set to 0, and it has been disconnected from all other pools on Stargate. Pathweights to and from Fantom have also been set to 0. As mandated by the proposal, Stargate has removed any POL from the Fantom pool and deposited this into the Ethereum USDC pool. 

Please note that this proposal does not affect the transfer of OFTs.

If you have questions, you can head to ⁠Unknown and they will get answered!

Hi all!  👋🏻  hope you're having a great day. 🔥  A bit of news:

The updated Vulcan Launcher is now available on our website to download. We have made some improvements as outlined below:

KEY CHANGES ✏️ 
Visual improvement to align to the Vulcan Studios brand. We will slowly introduce our Vulcan Studios brand (powered by Vulcan Forged) increasingly for our portfolio of games.
Minor improvements such as the capacity to close a pop-up for a game (top-right corner)
Reorganization of the games
In the background, we’ve optimized a few items but please note below the key impact moving forward.

IMPACT (PLEASE READ) :ForgeHammer: 
If you have never installed the Launcher or a game, proceed as you should. Download the launcher, then download the game you want to play and enjoy.
If you currently have the ‘old’ launcher, you can keep using it for now should you want to – but bear in mind we will stop updating games on it at some stage.
If, like many here you have the ‘old’ launcher AND have downloaded any of the games, the new launcher will require a fresh install of a game; it will not update a game that was installed on the ‘old’ launcher.
You should uninstall the current version of the game(s) you are playing first (this is optional – but suggested as the game will only take up unnecessary hard drive space).
Install the new launcher.
Install the game you want to play.
Log in and play! 🎮

VULCAN FORGED,Discord,"Hi @here!  Just a note for you based on VulcanVerse issues last week (Thurs 7th) with the introduction of version 1.2.5 - on Elysium(!) :Elysium: 

Staking was initially distributed for that day based on a user's individual average based on a period of time before that date. Following a discussion, we're now to adjust the staking reward to be the actual daily calculation, same as every other independent day. :VulcanVerse: 

A reminder - we have in place the XP stockpile system, where a user can earn enough XP to fill up the bars to cover several days. This means that short term VulcanVerse issues aren't too much of a problem as you only need fill those bars to cover staking XP.

Thanks to our team of VulcanVerse and My Forge devs, the majority of bugs that appeared as we migrated have been squashed 💥 - there are a couple of ongoing issues that we're aware of, rest assured these will be dealt with as we work to finalize migration.

VULCAN FORGED,Discord,"@here Just an update as we work on restructuring Discord - it'll no doubt be confusing for a short while, for those of us used to the old layout. But as we've covered in the blog, we've archived some little used or outdated channels, combined others (such as the social share channels, now ⁠content-creators covers all of that), made new categories as well as renaming some channels and creating new ones elsewhere. All of this with the aim of uncluttering and grouping channels logically.

There are some legacy channels that we'll keep for a short while and the likes of ⁠the-great-migration - which are temporary, will eventually be archived. There's a new, dedicated ⁠vulcanverse-talk channel purely for the VV discussion. The lounge (aka off topic) now fits our theme a little, it's the ⁠vulcan-city-taverna 

There are dedicated ⁠elysium-help and ⁠metascapes-help channels in the Elysium and MetaScapes categories, but all other support is under the Support category.

The Campaigns + Events category covers current events and so the channels within it will be temporary to one degree or another.

Testers, the @Game Council and wiki editiors get their own section, only visible to those involved ensuring there is less clutter.

The Misc category contains ⁠commands, ⁠ask-talos and, when we host them, the quiz channel.

The Vulcan Studios category contains channels for our games - bigger games have their own channel, there is also an 'other games' channel to cover the rest. Use the ⁠reaction-roles to ensure you can see the channels with the games you want to follow. 

There's surely more I haven't covered and still a couple of sections to tidy up, but that's enough to take in for now! :ForgeHammer:",0,marketing,

🚨 On-chain Proposal: Upgrade the GovernanceStrategy Smart Contract 🚨

🗳 Wintermute has created an on-chain proposal to upgrade the GovernanceStrategy Smart Contract to V2. This upgrade will ratify the implementation of $wethDYDX into dYdX v3’s governance system, so that $wethDYDX has the same voting and proposal power as $ethDYDX.

View the on-chain proposal 👉 https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/15 

🕑 Voting Ends: Sep 23, 2023, at 17:06 UTC 

Details about wethDYDX and the GovernanceStrategyV2 Smart Contract;
1️⃣ The wethDYDX Smart Contract could enable a permissionless and autonomous one-way bridge for the $ethDYDX token to be migrated from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain.
2️⃣ $wethDYDX is a transferable ERC-20 token based on Ethereum Mainnet that is issued 1:1 when $ethDYDX tokens are sent to the wethDYDX Smart Contract.
3️⃣ Upon a successful on-chain vote, a user holding $wethDYDX will be able to participate in dYdX v3 governance (voting and proposing). This is important to ensure dYdX v3's governance system remains robust, if and when more $ethDYDX tokens become permanently locked. 

Note, This DIP falls under the Long Timelock Executor, that has a 1 day delay, 10 days voting period (assuming average of 13.2 second block time), and followed by 7 days queuing time ⏳

In connection with a potential migration of DYDX from Ethereum (“ethDYDX”) to the dYdX Chain, the dYdX Foundation commissioned the development of two additional Ethereum smart contracts:
🧠GovernanceStrategyV2 smart contract, and
🌉TreasuryBridge smart contract.
🛡️ All three smart contracts have been audited by Peckshield.

🚨 Governance Announcement🚨 

Someone has created a Snapshot poll to ""skip testnet round 3, and go live with BETA v4"". 

Note, the dYdX Foundation is discouraging participation in the Snapshot vote and warning the dYdX community to avoid interacting with the Eth address that created the Snapshot vote because:

(1) there are reports that the address (0xa2A55dB3C3504e1C98286b9AB7c89213f3570288) that created the Snapshot vote was used in a phishing scam, 
(2) the dYdX community has no control over the testnet for dYdX v4, and
(3) there was no discussion on the dYdX community forum and this proposal did not follow the Proposal Lifecycle.

The dYdX Foundation urges the dYdX ecosystem, community members and the general public to remain vigilant as we anticipate an increase in potential scams and phishing attacks.

The dYdX community has voted in support of amending the dYdX Operations Trust Instrument❗

✅~12M DYDX from 480 addresses
❌~5K DYDX from 46 addresses

The proposal involved amending:

1️⃣ the Purposes section in the dYdX Trust Instrument to better reflect the DOT 2.0 mandate, and

2️⃣ the requirements within the dYdX Operations Trust Instrument, which now explicitly requires all Trustees to operate compliantly with all laws, regulations, and rules applicable to their duties and obligations.

@0xCharles recently interviewed with Ezra Reguerra from Cointelegraph at Korea Blockchain Week 🎤

In the interview Charles highlights that one of the issues faced by DEXs is the slow performance of on-chain order books. 

Charles goes on to mention, decentralized order books are a “new step forward”❗

“So, the architecture choice by dYdX engineers is to decentralize the order book, without adding it on-chain because it will be too slow. The decision was made to essentially host the order book within the memory of the validators”

If we can sell out the theaters they are currently scheduled to show the movie we believe we can get the major theaters to notice them! The goal is to get the movie into 1000 theaters. 
You can buy a ticket for yourself and go see the movie or you can buy ALOT of tickets and give them away so others can see the movie. And most importantly get the movie theaters to NOTICE!
This movie, imho, can change the world. We finally have a message of hope and whats more they've shown that you can make more money while saving the planet!
Even if you're on the opposite side of this issue if you care about the Gala Ecosystem you will promote the hell out of this movie. We will be driving a ton of Web2 users into our ecosystem and that will benefit everyone!

:polygon_circle: The moment we’ve all been waiting for has arrived. Phase 0 of Polygon 2.0 is now underway, 3 Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) and a roadmap for Phase 0 have been introduced today.

🌐 Polygon 2.0 aims to scale Ethereum blockspace to create the Value Layer of the Internet, providing unlimited scalability and unified liquidity.

The proposals detail the initial set of technical upgrades required to deliver this vision:
Initiation of POL upgrade.
POL to serve as the native (gas) token for PoS.
POL to serve as the staking token for PoS.
Launch of the Staking Layer, enabling validators to participate in a myriad of services across multiple chains in the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem.

🪷 No immediate action is required today for users of PoS and zkEVM networks, but what is needed from the community is your invaluable input.

✍️ Central to the Polygon 2.0 vision is the idea of empowering the community -- the builders, creators and all others who make the Polygon ecosystem possible. @everyone Please review the PIPs and provide feedback on the proposed changes and analyze if any changes could break your smart contracts. Developers for applications on the Polygon PoS should not see any breaking changes:
PIP #17
PIP #18
PIP #19

GM folks,

:polygon_circle: The moment we’ve all been waiting for has arrived. Phase 0 of Polygon 2.0 is now underway, 3 Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) and a roadmap for Phase 0 have been introduced today.

🌐 Polygon 2.0 aims to scale Ethereum blockspace to create the Value Layer of the Internet, providing unlimited scalability and unified liquidity.

The proposals detail the initial set of technical upgrades required to deliver this vision:
Initiation of POL upgrade.
POL to serve as the native (gas) token for PoS.
POL to serve as the staking token for PoS.
Launch of the Staking Layer, enabling validators to participate in a myriad of services across multiple chains in the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem.

🪷 No immediate action is required today for users of PoS and zkEVM networks, but what is needed from the community is your invaluable input.

✍️ Central to the Polygon 2.0 vision is the idea of empowering the community -- the builders, creators and all others who make the Polygon ecosystem possible. @everyone Please review the PIPs and provide feedback on the proposed changes and analyze if any changes could break your smart contracts. Developers for applications on the Polygon PoS should not see any breaking changes:
PIP #17
PIP #18
PIP #19

UNISWAP,Discord,"Meet UniswapX ⚡— a new permissionless, open source (GPL), auction-based protocol for trading across AMMs & other liquidity sources. We’re starting to roll UniswapX out as an opt-in beta in the Uniswap WebApp starting today. 

TL;DR: over time, it’ll give users more liquidity, better prices, MEV protection, & gas-free swapping!

UniswapX outsources the complexity of routing to an open network of fillers who compete to fill swaps at the best prices. What does this mean for swappers? As a competitive ecosystem of fillers forms, it will bring…

💸 Better prices 
⛽  Gas-free swapping
🤝 MEV protection
🤩 No cost for failed transactions

How is it gas free? ⛽ 🆓
Swappers sign an offchain order, which is submitted onchain by fillers who pay gas on swappers’ behalf to complete the transaction. Swappers don’t need a chain’s native token to trade and don’t have to pay for failed transactions 🔥🔥

And what about MEV protection? 
MEV is one of the biggest issues facing onchain swapping today.

With UniswapX, MEV that would be left on the table to be captured by an arbitrage transaction is instead returned to swappers through improved prices 💰

Later this year, we’ll launch a cross-chain UniswapX that combines swapping and bridging into one action ⚔️

Swappers will be able to swap between chains in seconds 💨 

This includes native asset swaps, reducing the need for bridged tokens 

UniswapX is built into the same interface you know and love, with the same principles of security, self-custody, and community that make Uniswap the most trusted name in DeFi 🦄

Like Ethereum, we see Uniswap as core financial infrastructure & think it should be built in public, with space for community feedback and contribution.

An early implementation of the code can be found here:
github.com/Uniswap/v4-core

Uniswap v4 enables powerful new ways to customize liquidity pools by introducing “hooks”.
Hooks add entirely new functionality to pools, such as dynamically adjusting fees or creating new order types 🪝

Our Vision for Uniswap v4
All about our vision for Uniswap v4 and why we're building in public.
Uniswap v4 enables powerful new ways to customize liquidity pools by introducing “hooks”.
Hooks add entirely new functionality to pools, such as dynamically adjusting fees or creating new order types 🪝
https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v4

We’ve written a few sample hooks to demonstrate their expressiveness & capabilities:
⌛ Time-weighted average market maker (TWAMM)
🔮 Customized onchain oracles
📖 Onchain limit orders
https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/tree/main/contracts/hooks/examples

Because each pool can be customizable, we expect to see pools of all shapes and sizes.
To meet a world with many pools, we made a number of architectural improvements 🚀
For a deep dive, check out our draft technical whitepaper about our vision for v4.
https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/whitepaper-v4-draft.pdf

v4 pools will live in a single contract, reducing the cost of pool creation by 99% 🔂
When combined with a new “flash accounting"" system, this greatly reduces the cost of routing across many pools ⚡

With custom pools and singleton, developers can leverage the security & network effects of Uniswap, without needing to build their own AMM from scratch.

🦾 We want Uniswap v4 to bring fast, expressive AMM innovation within one powerful ecosystem.

Developers!! Start thinking of cool hook designs & integrations 🔥
And to submit feedback and ideas for the core code, read our contribution guidelines 🧑‍💻

CHAINLINK,Twitter,"Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) settlement across two separate blockchains is a fundamental leap forward for the global financial system. 

Made possible by CCIP.                                                                                                                            

What is DvP? 

DvP is a form of settlement that requires payment for securities to be made before or at the same time as the securities are delivered. In other words, it ensures you get what you pay for. 

How did DvP work before blockchains?

Before blockchains, DvP settlement required trusting a centralized intermediary to facilitate the transaction. But all this did was swap one counterparty for another, albeit usually a larger counterparty with less solvency risk. It made settlement safer, but it didn’t make it safe. 

Why is Web3 a leap forward for DvP settlement?

DvP powered by Chainlink CCIP is a highly secure, flexible, and trust-minimized settlement process. Regardless of whether assets are stored on a private bank chain or public blockchain, CCIP can facilitate the secure settlement of assets without the need to trust any centralized intermediary or institution. Instead, asset owners can rely on smart contracts and cryptographic truth. 

Where we’re at right now:

ANZ is at the forefront of this innovation, using CCIP to demonstrate how tokenized assets can be settled securely cross-chain. But this is just the beginning. 

As the blockchain interoperability standard for capital markets, CCIP is on a path to underpin DvP settlements for markets transacting hundreds of trillions of dollars annually. 

CCIP is set to #LinkTheWorld

Following the successful migration of the Optimism mainnet to Bedrock, we have initiated the process of bringing Chainlink Data Feeds and Chainlink Automation services live.
During this time, we advise not consuming Chainlink Data Feeds or using Chainlink Automation. As our tests come to completion, we'll start making the services available. We'll keep you updated once all services are available to use!

As part of Optimism's roadmap to transition to the OP tech stack, the Optimism Mainnet will migrate to Bedrock on June 6th at 16:00 UTC. During this process, Optimism’s Mainnet will have a 2-4 hour downtime as the Optimism team performs the upgrade.

In preparation for this upgrade, we've partnered with Optimism’s team to ensure a smooth transition plan for the Chainlink Data Feeds and Chainlink Automation services that support your dApps.

When Chainlink services resume normal operations, we'll notify you through our standard communication channels.

PLEASE NOTE: During the downtime, please do not consume Chainlink Data Feeds or use Chainlink Automation services until we update you of the services availability. If you are actively consuming Chainlink Data Feeds or using Chainlink Automation on Optimism, we advise pausing your protocol operation in advance of the Bedrock upgrade.

:offchain: Offchain Labs recently released the code https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus and public testnet for Arbitrum Stylus! :Stylus: 

What is Stylus?👇

Arbitrum Stylus allows developers to use both traditional EVM tools and WASM-compatible languages like Rust, C, and C++ to build applications on Arbitrum Nitro chains!

Stylus dramatically lowers gas costs and enables new resource-intensive blockchain usecases like alternative signature schemes, larger generative art libraries, C++ based gaming, and compute-heavy AI models that were previously impractical.

What's next on the DAO front?👇

Since Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova are DAO-governed, it will be up to the DAO to vote on upgrading these chains to include Stylus support.

The motivation to change the election’s start date is to provide time for the implementation to be completed, security audits to be performed, for the community to gain confidence in the quality of its implementation & for the Arbitrum DAO to vote on a separate Constitutional AIP to install an on-chain election system.",,,
ARBITRUM,Discord,"Gm Arbinauts! 💙

The first Arbitrum Security Council elections are scheduled to start on the 15th of September ‘23.
As part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions, and there are important considerations for the community.

To provide the community with a secure on-chain election system, we have engaged Off Chain Labs and Tally to implement the on-chain smart contract suite and integrate the election system in their front end.

As the implementation continues, we want to keep the community informed since this is a critical part of the system.

You can check out this new forum post about the architecture and provide technical feedback back to the team:
Proposal: Security Council Elections Proposed Implementation Spec
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-security-council-elections-proposed-implementation-spec/15425

We have put together a new proposal that seeks consent from the Arbitrum DAO to modify the start date of the election:
Proposal: Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-update-security-council-election-start-date-to-ensure-time-for-security-audit/15426

The motivation for a new start date is threefold:
1) Allow for both the smart contract and user interface implementation to be completed,
2) Time to audit the smart contracts alongside resolving any identified issues,
3)  Allow the Arbitrum DAO to review, gain confidence, and vote to install the election software.

We hope everyone is excited about pursuing an on-chain election that empowers the Arbitrum DAO to propose, vote and install new security council members!

ARBITRUM,Discord,"Hello Arbinauts!:arbiblobblue: 

The Arbitrum DAO overwhelmingly voted for AIP-1.1:
https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/70545629960586317780628692755032548222173912190231545322320044688071893662480

AIP-1.1 relates to the Arbitrum Foundation's budget. It states that our treasury of 700m ARB must be locked in a vesting contract. The treasury should be released to the Foundation over a 4 year horizon:
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x15533b77981cDa0F85c4F9a485237DF4285D6844#code

The vesting contract is an important tool to allow the Arbitrum DAO to hold the Arbitrum Foundation accountable. The DAO has the authority to remove, shorten, or extend the vesting period.

The final step to complete AIP-1.1 requires the Arbitrum Foundation to send the 700m ARB treasury to the vesting contract. This transfer will happen shortly and you can watch it here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc24E24383120669512a336fB3B5B19aFB4CC2a56

Finally, the completion of AIP-1.1 and AIP-1.2 represents one small step for the Arbitrum DAO, but one giant leap for the Arbitrum ecosystem :arbblue: :one~1: :nova:
