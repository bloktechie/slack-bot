It will retain only synchronization-related endpoints for Full Nodes.\n\nThe Starknet feeder gateway serves as a gateway for querying the centralized sequencer on the state of Starknet. It was meant to be a temporary solution until Full Nodes supporting Starknet‚Äôs JSON-RPC mature and can meet the ecosystem's needs.\n\nWe are working with the different API providers to ensure they're preparing for the deprecation regarding reliability and expected increased traffic.\n\nWe will proceed with the deprecation only if we feel the ecosystem is ready.\n\nMoving towards Full Nodes and API services signifies transitioning from a centralized solution to a decentralized, resilient, and efficient system that aligns with blockchain technology principles.\n\nStarknet devs are recommended to shift to API services or Full Nodes like Pathfinder, Juno, and Papyrus.\n\nFor a full list of Full Nodes and API services üëá\n\nhttps://starknet.io/en/ecosystem/fullnodes-and-api-services\n\nRead more and join the discussion.\n\nhttps://community.starknet.io/t/feeder-gateway-deprecation/100233\n\n@AlchemyPlatform, @BwareLabs, @ChainbaseHQ, @ChainstackHQ, @NethermindEth, @lavanetxyz, @infura_io, @equilibrium_co, @StarknetFndn",

Following a discussion, we're now to adjust the staking reward to be the actual daily calculation, same as every other independent day. :VulcanVerse: \n\nA reminder - we have in place the XP stockpile system, where a user can earn enough XP to fill up the bars to cover several days. This means that short term VulcanVerse issues aren't too much of a problem as you only need fill those bars to cover staking XP.\n\nThanks to our team of VulcanVerse and My Forge devs, the majority of bugs that appeared as we migrated have been squashed üí• - there are a couple of ongoing issues that we're aware of, rest assured these will be dealt with as we work to finalize migration.\n\nForge on! :ForgeHammer:",

All of this with the aim of uncluttering and grouping channels logically.\n\nThere are some legacy channels that we'll keep for a short while and the likes of ‚Å†the-great-migration - which are temporary, will eventually be archived. There's a new, dedicated ‚Å†vulcanverse-talk channel purely for the VV discussion.

If we can sell out the theaters they are currently scheduled to show the movie we believe we can get the major theaters to notice them! The goal is to get the movie into 1000 theaters. \nYou can buy a ticket for yourself and go see the movie or you can buy ALOT of tickets and give them away so others can see the movie. And most importantly get the movie theaters to NOTICE!\nThis movie, imho, can change the world. We finally have a message of hope and whats more they've shown that you can make more money while saving the planet!\nEven if you're on the opposite side of this issue if you care about the Gala Ecosystem you will promote the hell out of this movie. We will be driving a ton of Web2 users into our ecosystem and that will benefit everyone!\n\nLastly all of the proceeds go to the support of this movie! This is not a Gala cash grab on any level.

Phase 0 of Polygon 2.0 is now underway, 3 Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) and a roadmap for Phase 0 have been introduced today.\n\nüåê Polygon 2.0 aims to scale Ethereum blockspace to create the Value Layer of the Internet, providing unlimited scalability and unified liquidity.\n\nThe proposals detail the initial set of technical upgrades required to deliver this vision:\nInitiation of POL upgrade.\nPOL to serve as the native (gas) token for PoS.\nPOL to serve as the staking token for PoS.\nLaunch of the Staking Layer, enabling validators to participate in a myriad of services across multiple chains in the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem.\n\nü™∑ No immediate action is required today for users of PoS and zkEVM networks, but what is needed from the community is your invaluable input.\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Central to the Polygon 2.0 vision is the idea of empowering the community -- the builders, creators and all others who make the Polygon ecosystem possible. @everyone Please review the PIPs and provide feedback on the proposed changes and analyze if any changes could break your smart contracts.

In other words, it ensures you get what you pay for. \n\nHow did DvP work before blockchains?\n\nBefore blockchains, DvP settlement required trusting a centralized intermediary to facilitate the transaction. But all this did was swap one counterparty for another, albeit usually a larger counterparty with less solvency risk. It made settlement safer, but it didn‚Äôt make it safe. \n\nWhy is Web3 a leap forward for DvP settlement?\n\nDvP powered by Chainlink CCIP is a highly secure, flexible, and trust-minimized settlement process. Regardless of whether assets are stored on a private bank chain or public blockchain, CCIP can facilitate the secure settlement of assets without the need to trust any centralized intermediary or institution. Instead, asset owners can rely on smart contracts and cryptographic truth. \n\nWhere we‚Äôre at right now:\n\nANZ is at the forefront of this innovation, using CCIP to demonstrate how tokenized assets can be settled securely cross-chain. But this is just the beginning. \n\nAs the blockchain interoperability standard for capital markets, CCIP is on a path to underpin DvP settlements for markets transacting hundreds of trillions of dollars annually. \n\nCCIP is set to #LinkTheWorld\nhttps://blog.chain.link/tokenization-for-capital-markets/\n",
